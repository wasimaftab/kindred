we found Arpc1 interacts with Arp2.Predicted networks of protein-protein interactions in Stegodyphus mimosarum by cross-species comparisons.Stegodyphus mimosarum is a candidate model organism belonging to the class Arachnida in the phylum Arthropoda.Studies on the biology of S. we found Arpc5 interacts with Arpc2. mimosarum over the past several decades have consisted of behavioral research and comparison of gene sequences based on the assembled genome sequence. we found Arp3 interacts with Arpc4.Given the lack of systematic protein analyses and the rich source of information in the genome, we predicted the relationships of proteins in S. mimosarum by bioinformatics comparison with genome-wide proteins from select model organisms using gene mapping.The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of 11 organisms were integrated from four databases (BioGrid, InAct, MINT, and DIP).we found AP-1mu interacts with AP-1gamma. Here, we present comprehensive prediction and analysis of 3810 proteins in S. mimosarum with regard to interactions between proteins using PPI data of organisms. Interestingly, a portion of the protein interactions conserved among Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster were found to be associated with RNA splicing. we found AP-1mu interacts with AP-1gamma. In addition, overlap of predicted PPIs in reference organisms, Gene Ontology, and topology models in S. mimosarum are also reported.we found AP-2mu interacts with AP-1sigma.
